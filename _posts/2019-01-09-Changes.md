# California vs Oregon
### _Trying to merge new and old_

**Observations**

Oregonians hate Californians that move up there. Portland, especially, wants to maintain a small metropolitan city feel; the influx of new residents to the city is challenging that desire.

Moving to the Bay Area from the Portland Metropolitan Area (not Portland itself, I was in a western suburb...another thing Portland residents don't like, suburbs.) :angry:  :unamused:
